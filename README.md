# Unit 1 Lesson 4 - Lab: Forms
## Quiz Your Friends!

### Directions
Whether it be anime, fashion, travel, music, your interests are all so interesting and unique. You each are an ✌🏾expert✌🏾 at something and your job is to create a quiz to test the expertise of your classmates!

You are to use and HTML Forms and CSS to create and style a 5 question quiz on a topic of your choosing. You are to use each of the following input types at least once:
* `text`
* `textarea`
* `select`
* `checkbox`
* `radio`

### Note
Styling for forms can range from annoying to extremely challenging. Simplicity rules here. Style your quiz to be clean, readable, and organized. No need for anything fancy or advanced. For an example, see [here](https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/full/VPaoNP)
